# RyanAir
Test App to Demo a Simple Search Form using RyanAir API

## Installation:
Install the frameworks using cocoapods with pod install and open the project workspace in Xcode

## Notes:
I have included cocoapod frameworks Lottie & SwiftLint Lottie - for a simple loading animation SwiftLint - to adhere to common coding standards
I could have spent more time, and implemented Unit Tests and implemented VIPER architecture, but I thought given the work already demonstrated that that would have been over-kill.
